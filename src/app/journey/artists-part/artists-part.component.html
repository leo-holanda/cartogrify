            Cartogrify has a little robot that travels around the world to find where your favourite
            artists comes from. Sometimes, he catches the wrong plane and his findings become... a
            little off-target.
          </p>

          <p>
            You can help him by suggesting the correct country of origin for the ones he got wrong.
            He always makes happy noises when this happen!
