  <p>
    Thank you for using Cartogrify, developed by Leonardo Holanda. I am committed to protecting your
    privacy and ensuring the security of your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how
    I collect, use, and share your information when you interact with the app.

    <h2>1. Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>
      We collect and store limited information about you when you use Cartogrify. Specifically, we
      collect:
    </p>

    <h3>Spotify Account ID</h3>
    <p>
      When your Country Diversity Index (how many different countries your top artists come from) is
      computed, it is necessary to make sure that it is associated to you. So, when you login, it
      updates instead of creating a new one. That's why your Spotify Account ID is collected. It's
      stored in a Supabase database and it isn't share with anyone.
    </p>

    <h3>Country Associated with Spotify Account</h3>
    <p>
      Cartogrify compares your Country Diversity Index with other users from your country. For that
      reason, I need to collect your country data. It's stored in a Supabase database and it isn't
      share with anyone.
    </p>

    <p>
      By using Cartogrify, you agree to my End User License Agreement, which includes additional
      terms and conditions governing your use of the app.

    <h3>3.1. Acceptance of Terms</h3>
